<objective>
Research and analyze CLASSIC 16-BIT ERA RPGs (1990-1999) to extract creative expansion ideas for our Rhythm RPG project. Focus on the golden age of pixel art RPGs, turn-based combat, and narrative-driven gameplay.

Your goal: Deep-dive into 15-20 classic RPGs from the 16-bit era, extract their innovative mechanics, art styles, storytelling techniques, and design philosophies, then generate 200+ creative ideas for how we can adapt and modernize these timeless concepts for our rhythm-based game.

**Output Folder:** `./creative-expansion-1/`
</objective>

<context>
**Your Focus:** Classic 16-bit RPGs (SNES, Genesis, PC era 1990-1999)
**Project:** Rhythm RPG (Godot 4.5.1) with 26 core systems implemented

**Why This Era Matters:**
The 16-bit era defined what RPGs could be: rich stories, memorable characters, strategic combat, beautiful pixel art, and worlds that felt alive. Games like Chrono Trigger, Final Fantasy VI, Earthbound, and Secret of Mana created design patterns still influential today.

**Your Mission:**
Mine this golden era for:
- Combat system innovations (turn-based, ATB, tactical)
- Character progression systems
- Story structure and pacing
- Pixel art excellence and animation techniques
- World design and exploration
- Music integration (how 16-bit music enhanced gameplay)
- UI/menu design that's still praised today
- Party systems and character interactions
