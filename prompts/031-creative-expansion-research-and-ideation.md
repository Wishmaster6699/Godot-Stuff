❌ "Create a few item names"
✅ "Generate 200+ item names that tell micro-stories and evoke emotional responses"

❌ "Research some similar games"
✅ "Deeply analyze 45+ games, extract their innovative mechanics, and show how we can combine/improve them"

## Be Specific AND Expansive

Don't just say "rhythm-based movement" - describe:
- 10 different ways rhythm could enhance movement
- How it feels to the player
- Visual feedback for each
- How it integrates with combat
- Godot 4.5 implementation approach
- Which games did this well and what we can learn

## Research Deeply

- Use Web Search extensively for EVERY topic
- Cite specific sources and insights
- Don't rely on general knowledge - find November 2025 innovations
- Cross-reference multiple sources
- Look for patterns and outliers

## Connect Everything

Show how ideas synergize:
- "If we implement rhythm-based crafting (idea #47) AND musical ingredient properties (idea #23), we could create a mini-game where recipe tempo affects item quality..."

## Be Inspirational

Write like you're pitching the most exciting game ever:
- Use evocative language
- Paint pictures with words
- Make readers FEEL the potential
- Show the emotional journey

## Ground In Reality

Balance ambition with feasibility:
- Note implementation complexity
- Suggest phasing (v1.1, v1.5, v2.0)
- Consider scope vs. impact
- Provide simpler alternatives to ambitious ideas

## Respect the Foundation

Build on what exists:
- Reference existing systems (S01-S26)

- Enhance, don't replace
- Maintain the vibe code philosophy

## Push Boundaries

Include "what if" explorations:
- "What if music could reverse time?"
- "What if enemies evolved based on player's musical style?"
- "What if the entire world was procedurally generated from music?"
- Some ideas will be too ambitious - document them anyway for future inspiration
