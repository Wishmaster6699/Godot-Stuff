**Your Focus:** Rhythm Games (2000-2010) - The rhythm game revolution
**Project:** Rhythm RPG (Godot 4.5.1) with 26 core systems implemented

**Why This Era Matters:**
2000-2010 saw rhythm games become mainstream phenomena. These games mastered the art of making players FEEL the music through tight timing, visual feedback, and escalating difficulty. They proved rhythm mechanics could be incredibly engaging and accessible.

**Your Mission:**
Extract the secrets of rhythm game excellence:
- Timing window systems and accuracy ratings (Perfect, Good, Miss)
- Visual feedback that makes rhythm feel satisfying
- Difficulty progression that keeps players in flow state
- Controller/input innovation (guitars, dance pads, touch screens)
- Music selection and pacing
- Multiplayer and competitive elements
- Accessibility features
- How to make rhythm mechanics addictive yet fair

## Phase 1: Game Research (6-8 hours)

Research and deeply analyze 15-20 games from this list:

**Must Research:**
- Guitar Hero series (2005-2010)
- Dance Dance Revolution series (arcade + console)
- Elite Beat Agents (2006)
- Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan series
- Rock Band series (2007-2010)
- DJ Hero (2009)
- Rhythm Heaven / Rhythm Tengoku (2006-2009)

**Additional Options:**
- Space Channel 5, Frequency, Amplitude, Donkey Konga, Samba de Amigo, Bust a Groove, PaRappa the Rapper 2, Um Jammer Lammy, Beatmania IIDX, Pop'n Music

For EACH game, document:
1. **Timing System** - How does it judge accuracy? (Perfect/Great/Good/Miss scales)
2. **Visual Feedback** - What tells the player they're on rhythm?
3. **Input Method** - How does the player interact? (buttons, motion, touch)
4. **Difficulty Curve** - How does it escalate challenge?
5. **Music Integration** - How is music selected and presented?
6. **Feedback Loop** - What makes it feel satisfying?
7. **Multiplayer/Social** - Competitive or cooperative elements?
8. **What We Can Adapt** - Specific mechanics for our RPG
