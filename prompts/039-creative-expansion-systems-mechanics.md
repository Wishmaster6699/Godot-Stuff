<objective>
Generate MASSIVE creative expansion focused on GAME SYSTEMS & MECHANICS for the Rhythm RPG project. This is comprehensive, ambitious, boundary-pushing creativity that reimagines and expands EVERY system in the game.

Your goal: Generate 1000+ creative ideas across ALL aspects of the project (mechanics, items, monsters, story, crafting, cooking, evolution, puzzles, skills, world-building, naming, art, music, and MORE) with special emphasis on innovative SYSTEM DESIGN and MECHANICAL DEPTH.

Think like a systems designer who sees connections everywhere. Every system should interact with every other system. Create emergent gameplay through system synergies.

**Your Creative Lens:** Systems & Mechanics Architecture
**Project:** Rhythm RPG (Godot 4.5.1) with 26 core systems

**Your Mission:**
You are the SYSTEMS ARCHITECT. Your job is to expand EVERYTHING with a focus on:
- How systems interconnect and create emergent gameplay
- Mechanical depth that rewards mastery
- Progression systems that hook players
- Resource management and economy design
- Risk/reward decision-making
- Player choice and meaningful consequences
- System loops that create addiction
- Unexpected system interactions

But don't ONLY focus on systems - expand EVERYTHING: items, monsters, story, crafting, cooking, puzzles, skills, world, names, art, music, and ideas we haven't thought of yet.
