<objective>
Research and analyze ACTION RPGs & ROGUELIKES (across all eras) to extract creative expansion ideas for our Rhythm RPG project. Focus on games that mastered combat feel, build diversity, progression systems, and the "just one more run" addiction loop.

Your goal: Deep-dive into 20+ action RPGs and roguelike/roguelite games, extract their combat systems, progression mechanics, build variety strategies, and replayability hooks, then generate 200+ creative ideas for making our rhythm RPG's combat and progression systems equally addictive and rewarding.

**Output Folder:** `./creative-expansion-5/`
</objective>

<context>
**Your Focus:** Action RPGs & Roguelikes (1990-2025)
**Project:** Rhythm RPG (Godot 4.5.1) with 26 core systems implemented

**Why These Genres Matter:**
Action RPGs and roguelikes have perfected combat feel, build variety, and progression systems. Games like Hades make players eager to die just to try a new build. Dead Cells makes combat flow like a deadly dance. Risk of Rain creates emergent chaos through item synergies. These games understand how to keep players engaged through gameplay systems alone.

**Your Mission:**
Master the systems that create addiction:
- Combat feel and game juice
- Build diversity and experimentation
- Meta-progression that respects player time
- Procedural generation with handcrafted quality
- Risk/reward decision-making
- Item synergies and emergent gameplay
- Difficulty curves and power fantasy
- "Just one more run" psychology
