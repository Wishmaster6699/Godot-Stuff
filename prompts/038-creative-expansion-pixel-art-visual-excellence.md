**Why Visual Excellence Matters:**
First impressions are visual. Games like Owlboy, Eastward, and Sea of Stars prove pixel art can be breathtaking. Players are drawn to beautiful visuals, and exceptional art direction creates memorable experiences. Our rhythm RPG needs to stand out visually - stunning pixel art will make players WANT to explore our world.

**Your Mission:**
Master pixel art excellence:
- Character sprite techniques and animation
- Environmental art and atmosphere creation
- Color theory and palette design
- Visual effects and particle systems
- Lighting and shading in pixel art
- UI/UX visual design
- Animation principles for limited pixels
- Art direction and cohesive visual identity
