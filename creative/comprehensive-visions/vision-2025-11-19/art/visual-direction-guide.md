# Visual Direction Guide: Rhythm RPG Art Bible

## Overall Aesthetic Direction

### Core Vision
Vibrant, expressive pixel art RPG world where visual design reinforces rhythm mechanics. Every visual element should communicate musical concepts through color, animation, and form.

### Inspirations
- **Color Vibrancy**: Sea of Stars (rich, diverse palettes)
- **Character Expression**: Owlboy (personality in design)
- **Atmospheric Lighting**: Hyper Light Drifter (mood through color)
- **Animation Quality**: Dead Cells (smooth, frame-rich animation)
- **Neon Elements**: Introduce musical-themed neon effects

### Visual Pillars
1. **Clarity**: Everything readable at gameplay distance
2. **Expression**: Character personality evident in design
3. **Music Integration**: Visual elements reinforce rhythm concepts
4. **Variety**: Diverse biome aesthetics prevent repetition
5. **Polish**: Animation quality and effects feel premium

## Aseprite Workflow Documentation

### Project Setup
1. Canvas Size: Create at 4x intended resolution
   - If game renders at 320x180, create at 1280x720
   - Final downscale maintains pixel perfection

2. Layer Organization:
   ```
   Project/
   ├── Background layers (locked)
   ├── Character body
   ├── Character clothing
   ├── Character hair
   ├── Hands/manipulation
   ├── Weapon/equipment
   ├── Effects/shadows
   └── Animation timeline
   ```

3. Color Management:
   - Import biome palette as color palette
   - Dithering enabled for gradient regions
   - Limited palette constraint (48-96 colors max)

### Animation Techniques
1. **Onion Skinning:** Essential - visualize previous/next frames
2. **Squash & Stretch:** Frame 1 of jump = vertical stretch, frame 4 (landing) = horizontal squash
3. **Key Framing:** Pose key frames first, fill between frames second
4. **Playback Speed:** Preview at actual game FPS

### Export Settings
- Format: PNG sprite sheets
- Sprite size: Per-character documented
- Include padding: 1-2 pixels between sprites
- Trim: Enabled to minimize sprite sheet size
- Naming convention: `character_action_00.png`

## Visual Consistency Guidelines

### Silhouette Clarity
- All designs recognizable in silhouette
- No overlapping details that create visual confusion
- Clear visual distinction between character types

### Color Usage Rules
1. Same color = same game element type (e.g., all items have golden accent)
2. Warm colors = player/allied elements
3. Cool colors = environmental/neutral elements
4. Saturation conveys importance (saturated = important)
5. Enemy colors avoid player color (prevents confusion)

### Animation Guidelines
1. Anticipation before every action
2. Follow-through on moving parts (hair, cloth, weapons)
3. Overlapping action creates natural feel
4. Exaggeration enhances personality
5. Timing varies by action (slow setup, fast action)

### Effect Design
- Particle effects use biome palette
- Impact effects are quick (3-6 frames, high impact)
- Trails follow weapon motion
- Glow/bloom used sparingly for emphasis
- Screen shake on major impacts (rhythm-synced)
