## Market Position

### Competition Analysis

**Rhythm Games:**

- Crypt of NecroDancer: Great roguelike, limited story
- Metal: Hellsinger: Great shooting, no progression

**Action RPGs:**
- Hades: Great progression, no rhythm

**Our Position:**
**Best of all worlds + rhythm innovation**

**Gap in Market:**
No comprehensive rhythm RPG with:
- Open world exploration
- Deep character relationships
- Monster collection
- Life simulation
- Musical education
- Narrative depth

**We fill this gap.**

- Procedural generation
- Modular design system

**Risk 4: Budget/Team Size**
- Mitigation: Start small (V1.1 scope)
- Early Access funding
- Kickstarter potential
- MCP GDAI for efficiency

**Risk 5: Market Saturation**
- Mitigation: Unique positioning
- No direct competitor
- Multiple genre appeal
- Educational angle

**Risk 6: Technical Complexity**

- Every action, every choice, pulses to the beat

**This is:**
- Part Hades (progression and feel)
- Part Persona (social bonds and style)
- Part Hi-Fi Rush (rhythm integration)

**But it's also:**
- **Something entirely new**

**A rhythm RPG that:**
- Teaches music theory
