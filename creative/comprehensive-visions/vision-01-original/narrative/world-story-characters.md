## PART 1: WORLD-BUILDING FRAMEWORK

### Setting Concept

**"The Fractured Harmony: A World Where Rhythm Is Life"**

Our world exists at the intersection of music and reality. Centuries ago, the world was unified under "The Great Harmony" - a perfect resonance that connected all life. Musicians were healers, rhythms healed wounds, and harmony brought peace.
