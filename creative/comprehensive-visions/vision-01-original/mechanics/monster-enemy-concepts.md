# Monster/Enemy System Expansion: 100+ Unique Enemy Concepts

## Design Philosophy

**Core Principles from Research:**
1. **Personality-Driven** (Undertale approach): Each enemy has distinct character and motivation
2. **Incremental Difficulty** (Hollow Knight approach): Enemies build on previous concepts with tactical tweaks
3. **Ecological Niche** (Monster Hunter approach): Each monster fills specific environmental/biological role
4. **Variety in Challenge**: Different enemies test different player skills and strategies
