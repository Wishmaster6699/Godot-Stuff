# Progression System Innovations: 50+ Creative Expansion Ideas

## Research Foundation

**Games Analyzed:**
- Hades: Meta progression via Mirror of Night (persistent, two-option system)
- Slay the Spire: Deck-building progression with synergies and variety
- Persona series: Social links creating multiple progression pathways
- Next Run (2025): Choice-first design with alternative solutions

**Key Insights:**
- Players want CHOICE in how they progress (not forced linear paths)
- Respecs/flexibility are important (Hades allows free respec)
- Multiple progression systems can coexist meaningfully
- Progression should feel like building personal identity, not following checklist

## IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

### Godot 4.5+ Systems

**Multi-Track Progression:**
```gdscript
extends Node

class_item ProgressionPath:
    var path_name: String
    var current_level: int = 0
    var xp: int = 0
    var unlocked_abilities: Array[String]
```

**Reputation System:**
```gdscript
var faction_reputation: Dictionary = {
    "harmonic_guild": 0,
    "rhythm_research": 0,
    "percussion_consortium": 0,
}
```

**Companion System:**
- Separate progression tracking for each companion
- Trust levels affecting ability power
- Musical synchronization calculations
- Harmony rating affecting team bonuses

### Data Structure
- Store multiple progression paths simultaneously
- Allow free respecs with low resource cost (Hades model)
- Track all tier levels independently
- Calculate synergy bonuses across systems
- Generate emergent playstyles from combinations

### UI Considerations
- Visual representation of multiple progression trees
- Faction reputation visible but not overwhelming
- Companion status in team formation screen
- Time/seasonal indicators obvious and accessible
- Respec confirmations clear
