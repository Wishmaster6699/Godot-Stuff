## Next Steps

These 250+ core system ideas form the foundation. Now let's expand:
- Items & Equipment (200+ ideas) → See `items-equipment-catalog.md`
- Monsters & Evolution (200+ ideas) → See `monsters-evolution-database.md`
- Skills & Abilities (150+ ideas) → See `skills-abilities-compendium.md`

**Remember:** Pick systems that synergize. A few deep, interconnected systems create more emergent gameplay than many shallow, isolated systems.
