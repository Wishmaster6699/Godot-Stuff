## 🎮 Key System Innovations

### 1. **Multi-Rhythm Combat System**
Fight multiple enemies with different tempos simultaneously. Switch between rhythm tracks mid-combat. Handle polyrhythmic boss battles where you must track 2-3 rhythms at once.

**System Interactions:**
- Mastery unlocks new rhythm styles
- Equipment modifies tempo handling
- Abilities allow rhythm manipulation
- Cooking buffs extend timing windows

### 2. **Dynamic Evolution System**
5-stage evolution chains with multiple triggers (level, items, location, time, stats, bonds). Branch evolutions allow strategic choice. Reverse evolution for flexibility.

**System Interactions:**
- Combat performance affects evolution speed
- Equipment provides evolution bonuses
- Cooking accelerates bond building
- Locations trigger special evolutions

### 3. **Rhythm-Based Crafting**
Every craft requires a rhythm mini-game. Perfect timing yields quality bonuses. Failed rhythms create degraded items but waste no materials (encourages experimentation).

**System Interactions:**
- Rhythm mastery from combat applies here
- Buffs from cooking improve crafting success
- Tools modify rhythm difficulty
- Materials have rhythm affinity

### 4. **Musical Genre Specialization**
Players choose combat styles (Jazz, Rock, Classical, Electronic, etc.). Each has unique mechanics, abilities, and equipment. Hybrid builds possible.

**System Interactions:**
- Genre affects monster capture rates
- Equipment has genre bonuses
- Abilities synergize within genres
- Evolution paths align with genres

### 5. **Living Economy System**
Dynamic pricing based on player actions. Material scarcity creates market opportunities. Investment systems generate passive income. Risk/reward trading mechanics.

**System Interactions:**
- Exploration discovers new markets
- Monster drops affect material prices
- Crafting creates supply/demand
- Time-based market fluctuations
