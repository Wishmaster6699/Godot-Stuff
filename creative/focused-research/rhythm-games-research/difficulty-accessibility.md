## Balancing Challenge and Accessibility

### Philosophy
**Core Principle:** Accessibility does not diminish challenge for those who want it

**Implementation:**
- Default difficulty targets experienced gamers
- Assists available but not forced
- Separate achievement tracks (optional)
- Cosmetic rewards for high difficulty
- No content gated behind difficulty

### Reward Scaling Options

**Option A: Scaled Rewards**

- Normal: 100% rewards
- Hard: 150% rewards
- Master: 200% rewards + cosmetics

**Option B: Equal Rewards**
- All difficulties give same gameplay rewards
- Harder difficulties add cosmetics only
- No power gating by difficulty

**Recommendation:** Option B with cosmetic prestige rewards

- In-game prompts when struggling
- "Try accessibility features?" after 3 deaths
- Positive framing, no shame

### Community Building
- Encourage sharing accessibility setups
- "My Setup" export/import
- Community guides for various needs
- Normalize assist usage
