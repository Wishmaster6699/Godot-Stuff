2. Anticipation animation (wind-up)
3. Hit animation (contact frame)
4. Sound effect (impact)
5. Screen shake (physical)
6. Particle explosion (visual flourish)
7. Damage number (feedback)
8. Enemy reaction (consequence)
9. Combo counter update (progress)
10. Haptic rumble (tactile)

**10 layers for one action = JUICE**

## Testing Game Feel

### Playtest Questions:
- Does every action feel responsive?
- Can you "feel" the rhythm?
- Do perfect hits feel satisfying?
- Do misses feel fair (not frustrating)?
- Do you want to play "just one more time"?

### Iteration Process:
1. Implement basic mechanics
2. Add juice (layer feedback)
3. Playtest
4. Identify weak feeling moments
5. Add more juice to weak spots
6. Repeat until excellent

---

## The 0.1 Second Rule

**Principle:** Every action must have feedback within 100ms (0.1 seconds)
- Visual feedback: <50ms
- Audio feedback: <100ms
- Haptic feedback: <50ms

**Why:** Human perception threshold
- Feels instant
- Maintains flow
- Prevents "unresponsive" feeling
