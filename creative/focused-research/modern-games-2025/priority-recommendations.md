## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Areas:
1. **Rhythm System Accessibility** - If deaf players can't play, major problem
   - *Mitigation:* Visual rhythm cues from day 1, test with accessibility consultants

2. **Performance on Low-End Hardware** - Can't hit 60 FPS = bad reviews
   - *Mitigation:* Scalable graphics, test on minimum spec early

3. **Save System Bugs** - Data loss = rage refunds
   - *Mitigation:* Multiple backups, extensive testing, cloud saves

4. **Scope Creep** - Trying to do everything = shipping nothing
   - *Mitigation:* Stick to Phase 1 ruthlessly, resist feature creep

### Medium-Risk Areas:
5. **Localization Quality** - Bad translation = negative reviews in region
   - *Mitigation:* Native speakers, professional translation service

6. **Controller Support Edge Cases** - Unusual controllers breaking game
   - *Mitigation:* Steam Input API, extensive controller testing

7. **Steam Deck Performance** - Growing platform, can't ignore
   - *Mitigation:* Regular testing on Deck, performance optimization

---

## Testing Priorities
