## Critical for Rhythm RPG

Our rhythm-based gameplay makes certain accessibility features **absolutely essential**:

1. **Visual rhythm indicators (#21)** - Deaf/hard-of-hearing must be able to play
2. **Timing window adjustments (#26)** - Motor impairments need generous windows
3. **Vibration patterns for rhythm (#21)** - Alternative sensory input for beats
4. **Auto-rhythm mode** - From modern-rhythm-integration.md #51
5. **Rhythm practice slow-down** - From modern-rhythm-integration.md #54

**Without these, our game is inaccessible to significant portion of potential players.**

## Budget Considerations

**Free/Low Cost:**
- Most toggle options (motion blur, camera shake, etc.)
- Sliders for existing systems
- Control remapping (engine support)
