## Core UI Philosophy (2025)

**Principles:**
- **Clarity over Complexity** - Information hierarchy is king
- **Responsive Feedback** - Every input acknowledged immediately
- **Contextual Adaptation** - UI changes based on context
- **Minimal but Complete** - Show what's needed, hide what's not
- **Accessibility First** - Readable, scalable, customizable

## HUD & In-Game UI

### 1. **Clean, Minimal HUD**
- Only essential information visible during gameplay
- Health, resources, combo meter, current objective
- Everything else hidden until needed

(Modern standard from Hi-Fi Rush, Spider-Man)

(Player customization)

### 4. **Visual Hierarchy Through Design**

(Information architecture)

### 5. **Color-Coded Information**
