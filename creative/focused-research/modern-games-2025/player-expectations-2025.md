## Final Thought

What was "nice to have" in 2020 is "must have" in 2025:
- Accessibility was nice → Now essential

Games that don't meet 2025 expectations get:
- "Feels dated"
- "Lacking basic features"
- "Not worth full price"
- "Wait for sale"
- Negative reviews and refunds

Games that exceed 2025 expectations get:
- "Best indie of the year"
- "AAA polish at indie price"
- "Respects your time"
- "Accessible to everyone"
- Positive reviews and strong sales

**Our Rhythm RPG must meet or exceed these expectations to succeed in 2025's competitive market.**
