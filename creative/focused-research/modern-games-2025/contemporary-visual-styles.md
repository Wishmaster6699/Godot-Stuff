## The Visual Excellence Standard

Modern pixel art games (2020-2025) have proven that 2D can compete with AAA 3D in visual quality. Players expect:

- **Technical mastery** (lighting, shaders, particles)
- **Artistic excellence** (color, composition, style)
- **Smooth animation** (12-24 fps minimum)
- **Visual clarity** (readable, accessible)
- **Performance** (60 FPS standard)
- **Polish** (every detail considered)

Our Rhythm RPG should meet these standards while developing unique visual identity that makes it instantly recognizable.
