## 🎯 Design Philosophy

### Every Item Tells a Story
No generic "Sword +1" here. Every weapon, armor piece, and consumable has personality, lore, and flavor.

### The Dopamine Hit
We've designed the loot system around that incredible feeling when you:
- Open a legendary chest
- Get a rare boss drop
- Complete a difficult achievement
- Find a hidden treasure
- Evolve your favorite monster

### Meaningful Choices
With 55 armor sets, 120 weapons, and countless combinations, players have real agency in how they build their character.

### Depth & Variety
- **Horizontal Progression**: Many playstyles, not just "bigger numbers"
- **Collection Systems**: Gotta catch (and craft, find, evolve) 'em all
- **Multiple Paths**: Combat, crafting, cooking, performing, exploring

### Musical Integration
Everything ties back to the core theme: **MUSIC**. Every item, enemy, skill, and location is infused with musical concepts.
