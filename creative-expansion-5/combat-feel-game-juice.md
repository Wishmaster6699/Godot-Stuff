## Design Principles

1. **Every Action Gets Feedback**
   - Never let player input go unacknowledged
   - Visual + Audio + Haptic = full feedback loop
   - Instant feedback (<50ms delay)

2. **Rhythm Is Primary**
   - All feedback syncs to music
   - Perfect timing = maximum satisfaction
   - Off-timing = deliberately unsatisfying

3. **Escalation and Payoff**
   - Small combos = small effects
   - Large combos = explosive effects
   - Always reward improvement

4. **Clarity Through Noise**
   - Lots of effects, but never obscure gameplay
   - Important info always readable
   - Visual hierarchy maintained

5. **Make Mistakes Feel Fixable**
   - Don't punish too hard
   - Quick recovery encouraged
   - Mistakes teach without frustrating
