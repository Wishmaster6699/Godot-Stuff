## Core Action RPG Analysis

**1. Hades (Supergiant Games)**
- **What Makes It Special**: Roguelike with deep narrative progression, emotional character development through multiple playthroughs

- **Progression**:
  - Meta-progression (upgrades permanent between runs)
  - Mirror of Night system (difficulty modifiers, optional)
  - Heat system (optional difficulty increasers)
  - Weapon leveling through use
- **Narrative Innovation**: Story progresses across multiple runs, not linear. NPCs react to your choices
- **Why It Works**:

**3. Hollow Knight (Team Cherry)**
- **What Makes It Special**: Metroidvania masterpiece, precise platforming + soulslike combat, minimalist storytelling
- **Combat System**: Single melee weapon (nail) with special abilities. Focus on learning enemy patterns
- **Progression**: Ability unlocks gate progress (Metroidvania). Charm system modifies playstyle
- **Difficulty**: Boss fights require pattern memorization. Fair but unforgiving
- **Why It Works**:
  - Weapon limitation forces skill mastery
  - Charms create interesting build variety from limited resources
  - Boss design teaches mechanics through encounters
  - World design creates sense of discovery
- **What We Can Learn**:
  - Single weapon can work if combined with ability variety

  - Synergies reward experimentation and mastery
  - Enemy patterns are visually clear
  - Pixel art aesthetic enhances charm
- **What We Can Learn**:
  - Synergy systems create emergent gameplay
  - Visual clarity in bullet patterns is essential
  - Weapon variety sustains replayability
  - Challenge rooms offer optional difficulty

**6. Risk of Rain 2 (Hopoo Games)**
- **What Makes It Special**: 3D roguelike with escalating difficulty, item synergies, chaotic fun
- **Combat System**: Character abilities differ significantly. Items modify abilities (synergies)
- **Progression**: Unlock new characters and items through play
- **Scaling Difficulty**: Time-based scaling creates mounting tension
- **Why It Works**:
  - Item synergies create wildly powerful combinations
  - Time pressure creates mounting tension
