<objective>
Research and analyze MUSIC & RHYTHM GAMES (1990-2025) to extract creative expansion ideas for our Rhythm RPG project. This is the DEFINITIVE rhythm game research - covering every era, every sub-genre, every innovation in rhythm-based gameplay across gaming history.

Your goal: Deep-dive into 30+ rhythm and music games spanning 35 years, extract EVERYTHING about rhythm mechanics, music integration, timing systems, visual feedback, audio design, and player engagement, then generate 250+ creative ideas that make our rhythm RPG the pinnacle of rhythm game design.

**Output Folder:** `./creative-expansion-6/`
</objective>

<context>
**Your Focus:** Music & Rhythm Games (1990-2025) - Complete genre history
**Project:** Rhythm RPG (Godot 4.5.1) with 26 core systems implemented

**Why This Is Critical:**
This is THE core research for our rhythm RPG. While other agents study RPGs, action games, and art styles, YOU are the rhythm expert. You must understand everything ever done with rhythm mechanics, from PaRappa to Hi-Fi Rush, from arcade classics to modern innovations. Every timing window, every feedback system, every music integration technique - it all goes here.

**Your Mission:**
Become the ultimate rhythm game expert:
- Every rhythm mechanic ever invented
- How games teach rhythm (tutorials and learning curves)
- Visual feedback systems that make rhythm intuitive
- Audio design that enhances rhythm gameplay
- Accessibility in rhythm games
- Music selection and licensing strategies
- Multiplayer rhythm mechanics
- How to make rhythm fun for non-musicians
- Advanced techniques for rhythm masters
