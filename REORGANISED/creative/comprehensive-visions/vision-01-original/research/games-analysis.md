- Beat-matching doesn't need to be punishing; challenge comes from tactical decisions
- Movement IS the beat system; don't separate movement from rhythm
- Roguelike structure creates replayability
- Different enemies force different rhythm approaches
- Creating music that incentivizes on-beat play (gold multiplier)

**Takeaways for Our Game:**
- Beat tolerance can be generous while maintaining difficulty
- Rhythm should enhance strategy, not overshadow it
- Enemies should actively use rhythm in tactical ways
- Reward consistency with progression/multipliers
