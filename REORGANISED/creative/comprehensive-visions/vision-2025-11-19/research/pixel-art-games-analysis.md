## Pixel Art Technical Specifications (2025 Standards)

### Canvas Sizes (Before Downsampling)
- Tiny sprites: 64x64 (upscaled from 16x16)
- Standard characters: 256x256 (upscaled from 64x64)
- Detailed characters: 512x512 (upscaled from 128x128)
- Large sprites: 1024x1024 (upscaled from 256x256)

**Best Practice**: Create at 4-8x intended display size, then downscale for final pixel-perfect look.

### Animation Frame Counts (Modern Standard)
- Idle: 4-8 frames (looping)
- Walk cycle: 8-12 frames
- Run cycle: 10-14 frames
- Attack: 8-12 frames
- Hit/Pain: 4-6 frames
- Special/Ultimate: 20+ frames

### Layer Organization (Aseprite Best Practice)
```
Project Structure:
├── Background layers
├── Main character layer
├── Shadow/depth layer
├── Effects layer (particles, glow)
├── UI overlay layer
└── Animation timeline
```

## Color Palette Strategy (2025 Approach)

### Palette Development Process
1. **Reference Collection**: Study 10+ games with similar mood
2. **Core Palette**: 16-32 core colors for entire game
3. **Biome Variations**: 8-12 additional colors per biome
4. **Lighting Variations**: 2-4 versions (day/night/magical/etc)
5. **Seasonal Variants**: Different palettes per season

### Example: Main Game Palette (32 colors)
```
Background Neutrals:
- Dark background: #1a1a2e
- Mid background: #2d2d44
- Light background: #4a4a6a

Foreground Actionable:
- Player accent: #ff6b6b
- Enemy primary: #ee5a6f
- Item highlight: #ffd93d

Environmental:
- Grass: #6bcf7f
- Water: #4d96ff
- Stone: #8b9dc3
- Fire: #ff8c42

UI:
- Text primary: #ffffff
- Text secondary: #cccccc
- UI accent: #00d4ff
```

### Biome Variations
**Forest Biome Addition:**
- Deep forest: #1b4332
- Leaf accent: #52b788
- Moss: #74c69d

**Desert Biome Addition:**
- Sand primary: #f4a460
- Sand dark: #cd853f
- Rock: #a0826d

## Animation Techniques (2025 Best Practices)

### Squash & Stretch
- Jumping: Squash on landing, stretch on ascent
- Landing impact: Brief squash for feedback
- Attack impact: Slight squash on hit

### Anticipation
- Before action, subtle pose shift
- Wind-up before attack
- Brief pause before movement

### Follow-Through
- Hair/cloth follows body movement
- Weapon trails action
- Secondary parts move after primary

### Overlapping Action
- Body moves, then limbs catch up
- Head turns slightly after body
- Creates natural, fluid motion

### Timing Variation
- Not all actions same speed
- Slow anticipation + fast action + slow recovery = satisfying
- Rhythm tied to music timing
