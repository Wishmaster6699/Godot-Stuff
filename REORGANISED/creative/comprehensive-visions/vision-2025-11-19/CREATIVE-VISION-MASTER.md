## Key Concepts & Definitions

### Polyrhythm
Multiple simultaneous rhythms with different time signatures (e.g., 4/4 + 3/4 + 5/4). Core mechanic allowing difficulty progression.

### Resonance Alignment
Player's personal harmony state affecting available abilities and story outcomes. Ranges from harmony (order) to dissonance (chaos).

### Rhythm Personality
Each enemy/NPC/mechanic has intrinsic rhythm pattern they follow. Knowing/predicting these patterns is key to victory.

### Music-Affects-World
Concept that player's musical choices literally shape game world. Different genres/tempos = different environmental/story effects.

### Beat Synchronization
Precise timing requirement for actions, typically ±timing window from exact beat (e.g., ±0.2 seconds).

## The Vision in One Paragraph

A **polyrhythm-based action RPG** where **music IS the primary gameplay mechanic**. Players master increasingly complex rhythms to unlock abilities, defeat enemies with unique rhythm signatures, and shape a world where musical choices have tangible narrative impact. Visually stunning pixel art across 8 distinct biomes, each with their own color identity. Rich character-driven narrative with 10+ protagonist options, multiple endings, and companion story arcs that compete with combat for player attention. Accessible difficulty options allow casual players to experience the story while providing skill ceiling for rhythm masters. Multiplayer cooperation (v1.5+) requires synchronizing rhythms between players. Procedural generation (v2.0) creates infinite unique challenges. This is a game where **your musical skill is literally your character's power**.
